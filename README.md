# Bachelor Thesis in Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence at Tilburg University 
## Interpretable Breast Cancer Classification

In my Bachelor Thesis in explored the potential of Deep Learning methods for breast cancer classification. I focused on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify normal, benign, and malignant breast tissue in mammograms. 
Additionally, I applied several post-hoc interpretability techniques to gain insights into the decision-making process of CNNs, shedding light on their 'black-box' predictions. 
Moreover, as part of this research, I created a new dataset of preprocessed mammograms which is available on Kaggle (https://lnkd.in/e3TYk7uG).
